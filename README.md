## Gravity Simulation
Gravity Simulation is a simple program that simulates the behavior of celestial bodies under the influence of gravity source. 
The user can create gravity sources and particles that are subject to gravitational forces. 
The simulation updates the position and velocity of the bodies at each time step, and displays their trajectories and interactions.

## Memory Game (Simon game)
Memory Game is a classic memory game in which the player must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. 
The game features four buttons, each of which produces a unique sound and flashes a different color. 
The computer generates a sequence of buttons that the player must repeat.
